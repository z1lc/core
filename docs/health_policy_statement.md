# Health Policy Statement
Last reviewed *March 30, 2021*

This document defines the goals for my health. I start very high-level and get more specific as the document continues. The rate at which I expect to change these goals increases as I get more specific. See also my [investment policy statement](investment_policy_statement.md), which this document is inspired by.

## Health Objectives

I expect changes in this category to come **very** rarely, perhaps a few times a decade at most.

#### I. Maximize years of life _with vitality_
* Living to 90 while able to go out on jogs is preferable to living to 95 with the last decade in a wheelchair. The marginal benefit of an additional year of life continues decreasing as you age, and may potentially even become negative if quality-of-life gets poor enough.

#### II. Consistently feel good
* My day-to-day experience should not involve any time with predictably consistent pain or discomfort. Waking up tired, having trouble with my heel, or dealing with allergies are all examples of things that should be dealt with as diseases if they come up often.

#### III. Stay competitive in weightlifting & sports with my teenage kids
* Being able to be physically involved in my kid’s active interests is something I very much look forward to. Depending on when exactly I have my last child, the upper limit here could mean staying in good shape past the age of 50. 

## General Beliefs
Changes in this category may come 1-2 times per year, particularly as I learn more about health.
* **Change inputs instead of outputs.** When considering health interventions, I should prefer to change things like diet, sleep, and exercise instead of trying to fix symptoms by getting a surgery or starting to supplement with an exogenous compound. This is less risky from the perspective of potential side-effects, but also avoids the serious risk of medical errors (which [rank as the third-leading cause of death in the US](https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/)!).
* **Humility.** The reality of healthcare is that our understanding of the body and its processes is extremely limited. We have learned a good amount by controlling inputs & tracking outputs, but it’s mostly a black box.

## Specific Implementation Details
Changes may happen frequently in this category (multiple times a year), since they are highly dependent on my current job situation (retired vs. not), location, living situation, relationship status, etc.
* **Use Fitbit to track cardiovascular exercise & sleep times.** According to the CDC, this should be at minimum 150+ active zone minutes weekly, with a stretch goal of 300+ minutes. 7+ hours is CDC’s recommendation for sleep. The benefit of using Fitbit is that the tracking is quite accurate and only requires wearing the watch.
* **Regularly get full blood tests and use InsideTracker to track the results over time.**
* **Regularly record weight and blood pressure.**
* **Cook 80%+ of total meal intake.** For me, cooking vs. take-out approximates healthy vs. not-so-healthy eating. As a rule of thumb, this translates to at most 1 meal (of 3) that are consumed when eating out per week. I’ll continue to edit a recipes document that catalogues my favorites.
* **Continue increasing health-related knowledge.** In 2018, I invested time into reading Understanding Nutrition. This effort significantly improved my ability to make informed dietary choices; I should aim to find similarly-comprehensive volumes for other aspects of health.
