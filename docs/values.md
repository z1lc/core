# Personal Values
Values I try to live by. Last reviewed *December 17, 2022*.

## Health
Physical, mental, emotional, spiritual.

## Relationships
Romantic partners, family, friendships, communities.

## Curiosity
Intellectual, experiential, creative.

## Confident Optimism
The default expectation is positive.

# Personal Beliefs
Ideas that sit between the high-level values above and more specific [mental models](mental_models.md).

## Focus
Make hard decisions about what to pursue and what to throw away. Concern yourself with as few things as possible.

## Neuroplasticity

Your beliefs influence your own perception of reality and can even become self-fulfilling. Purposefully select beliefs for yourself instead of being subject to them.

## Action
In general, it is better to take action and fail than to have never taken action at all. Focus on potential growth stemming from an activity and get comfortable accepting downside risk.

## Consistency
> "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." (Calvin Coolidge)

Persistent, incremental application of effort outperforms one-time, herculean pushes. When thinking about longer-term wants, rely on discipline, not motivation; prefer creating systems rather than working towards goals.
