# Personal Values
Values I try to live by.

## Focus
Make hard decisions about what to pursue and what to throw away. Concern yourself with as few things as possible.

## Action
In general, it is better to take action and fail than to have never taken action at all. Focus on potential growth stemming from an activity and get comfortable accepting downside risk.

## Measurement
> "The first rule is that a measurement–any measurement–is better than none." (Andy Grove in *High Output Management*)

Thoughtful input and output metrics can accurately capture progress on goals; assessments become less susceptible to mental biases when informed by objective data. Start measuring with *some* metric and refine the definition over time.

## Consistency
> "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race." (Calvin Coolidge)

Persistent, incremental application of effort outperforms one-time, herculean pushes. Rely on discipline, not motivation; prefer creating systems rather than working towards goals.
