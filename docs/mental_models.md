# Mental Models
This is a list of approaches to thinking about problems that I have consistently found valuable. I'm also including ideas that don't quite make the cut for personal values but are still useful enough to warrant a call-out.

## Power Law / 80-20 Rule
  - Performance in most activities in life follows a power law distribution; there are portions of a whole that give you an outsize amount of value for the input you put in.
  - **Questions to ask**:
    - What part of this activity can give me most of the value while only requiring a little effort?
    - What portions of an activity can I avoid doing altogether because it doesn't result in a high return-on-effort?
  - **Examples**:
    - Reading Books
      - Problem: Books contain interesting ideas that you want to be exposed to. However, reading a book is usually a multi-hour commitment and most books contain a low signal-to-noise ratio.
      - Poor solutions
        - Try speed-reading or skimming books to get the core ideas quicker (research shows results in far lower comprehension; reading becomes more tiring)
      - Ideal solution
        - A huge amount of the value from a book can be extracted through quasi-automated means. Extract such information and retain it with a spaced repetition system.
          - Some of the value from reading a book is simply knowing about it, in order to develop your knowledge graph for when you see it mentioned in text or conversation. For this, you really only need the title, author, and a one-sentence summary.
          - A larger portion of the value is familiarity with the subject, vocabulary, and important people associated with the book. For this, you can export a glossary and use a Named Entity Recognizer library to extract core concepts.
        - The two activities above should take <5% of the total time required to read a book, but give you >>5% of the value. Additionally, if you decide that the book is worth the multi-hour commitment to receive the remaining value, you will have a much easier time comprehending the information thanks to the work you did up-front to familiarize yourself with the topic.

## Create Systems, Don't Solve Problems
First encountered in [*The Effective Executive*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48019.The_Effective_Executive) by Peter Drucker: "All events but the truly unique require a generic solution."
  - Most problems that are encountered in life are not one-off or unique; they are usually symptomatic of a greater issue and/or are recurrent problems. Find systematic solutions to problems that:
    - are general enough to solve the problem at its core
    - are scalable enough so that they are able to accommodate different iterations of the problem
    - are final such that you never have to deal with the problem again.
  - **Questions to ask**:
    - Is the problem I'm experiencing part of a greater issue?
    - How might I solve this problem so I don't experience it again in the next week? How about in the next month, year, or decade?
  - **Examples**:
    - Forgetting Information
      - Problem: When I consume information I'd like to remember, without any additional effort, I will generally forget 95%+ of it within 6 months.
      - Poor solutions
        - Try to read more about diverse topics to refresh memory in different areas. (does not solve problem of retaining specific information)
        - Keep a document of notes that you review to keep information fresh. (does not scale)
      - Ideal solution
        - Use a spaced repetition system that automatically keeps all relevant facts fresh. Create a daily habit to use such a system.
          - General: works for any knowledge that can be tested in a question-and-answer format
          - Scalable: scales up to 100s of thousands of facts
          - (nearly) Final: as long as I do my daily reviews, I will retain ~80-90% of the information within the system.
    - Battery-powered Electronics
      - Problem: Electronics can occasionally end up being at low amounts of charge at inopportune times. E.g., a electric toothbrush before a long trip, wireless headphones before heading out to the gym, etc.
      - Poor solutions
        - Scramble to charge devices right before they require use. (not really a solution)
        - Bring along additional charging cables or a portable charger. (treats symptom, not core problem)
      - Ideal solution
        - Create a recurrent task to charge all your batteries. Set the cadence to less than the period of time it takes any of the electronics get to low battery.
          - General: works for any new battery-powered device
          - Scalable: can work for up to ~15 devices
          - Final: as long as weekly task is fulfilled, I will never experience the problem again
        - In this case, a weekly task to charge all devices solves this problem for all electronics, permanently going forward.

## BATNA
First encountered in [*Getting to Yes*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes) by Roger Fisher and William Ury (see Chapter 6)
  - In any negotiation, each party has a BATNA, or a Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. The BATNA (and a party's knowledge of the counterparty's BATNA) generally drives the results of a negotiation. This extends to any selection among alternatives or option to do or not do something.
  - **Questions to ask**:
    - If this course of action is unsuccessful, what is the maximum downside I face?
    - How does the potential upside from this action compare to the maximum potential downside?
    - What alternatives do I have if this approach does not work?
    - Can I develop new alternatives to improve my negotiating position?
  - **Examples**:
    - Craigslist
      - Problem: You want to buy a dresser listed on Craigslist, but you don't want to pay more than you need to.
      - Poor solutions
        - Contact the seller, quoting a lower price without providing a compelling reason why your price is fairer.
      - Ideal solution
        - Spend time developing your BATNA by looking at similar dressers listed on Craigslist. Increase the number of alternatives by widening your search to include designs that don't exactly match what you're looking for, or perhaps are a bit further away than you'd like to drive. Select 1-2 candidate listings that are close to the original listing but offer more attractive prices, and include a reference to them in your offer to the first seller. This seller will be more likely to consider your reduced price if it is backed by legitimate BATNAs, as compared to simply asking for a lower price.

## Embrace Reality
First encountered in [*Principles*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles) by Ray Dalio
  - Many things in life do not work in a way that you would expect them to, or even in a way that logically makes sense. Instead of vainly resisting such setups, seek to understand them so that you can use them productively for your own goals.
  - **Questions to ask**:
    - What social conventions am I resisting that do not actually appreciably impact my life?
    - Can you think of a case where you are ignoring real-world feedback that an approach is faulty?
  - **Examples**:
    - Fundraisers
      - Problem: Individual-driven fundraisers (e.g. GoFundMe, Girl Scout Cookies) are generally an inefficient way to raise money for an organization and have the potential to create awkward social interactions, in cases where your individual values do not align with those of the organization.
      - Poor solutions
        - Refuse to contribute to fundraisers that you wouldn't contribute to yourself on your own volition. Ensure all your monetary contributions align with your values.
      - Ideal solution
        - Realize that most fundraisers require a symbolic contribution to achieve the greater goals of maintaining a positive relationship and having an interaction go well. Do not fret over small amounts given to causes that may not be of personal interest to you, or that involve poor ways of raising money. 
## Antifragility
First encountered in [Antifragile](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
  - Building a fragile system that assumes a predictable world is setting yourself up for failure. When designing solutions, consider how you might move up the fragility ladder:
    - fragile (breaks down when encountering exceptions)
    - robust (tolerates exceptions)
    - flexible (can be reconfigured to work around exceptions)
    - resilient (can self-recover from exceptions)
    - antifragile (thrives from exceptions)
  - **Questions to ask**:
    - How does the system behave when we violate an assumption or introduce exceptional behaviors?
    - Is there an opportunity to deliver unique benefit when in a failure condition? 
  - **Examples**:
    - Todo system
      - Problem: I have a collection of tasks to complete, but varying time in which to complete them. Tasks vary in urgency and importance.
      - Solutions with decreasing fragility:
        - Fragile / semi-robust: Work on tasks in a top-down fashion. When facing a time constraint, whatever tasks happened to be last will be left uncompleted.
        - Flexible: Manually prioritize tasks when you realize you may not have enough time to complete all of them. Requires the ability to forecast available time & motivation/ability to complete a specific number of tasks in a given time.
        - Resilient: Automatically order tasks by decreasing importance. May mean that highest-priority tasks get completed more often at the expense of significantly-overdue lower-priority tasks.
        - Antifragile: Automatically order tasks by decreasing importance and decreasing overdue-ness. Generally, the more over-due a task is, the more benefit you gain from a unit of work on that task (for example, it is likely higher ROI to clean the gutters after 3 years than after 1 year).
