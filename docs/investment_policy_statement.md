# Investment Policy Statement

This document is meant to define goals for my investments. I start very high-level and get more specific as the document continues. The rate at which I expect to change these goals increases as I get more specific. See the [Bogleheads wiki entry](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement) for background on general goals of writing an IPS.

## Investment Objectives

I expect changes in this category to come **very** rarely, perhaps a few times a decade at most.

#### I. Effectively balance long-term focus with short-term flexibility.
 * I have been heavily influenced by ideas from [FIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) when considering investments. Someone that has a non-zero expectation of early retirement, even if temporary, will have a different investment approach than a lifetime wage earner. I want to achieve the benefits of the FIRE lifestyle without having to commit to a specific spending rate and retirement age. Mini-retirements, such as between jobs or when having kids, are the goal.
 * Money not invested in risky assets that is unused in the time period it is intended for is wasted. Therefore, I need to resist over-provisioning for short-term flexibility to maximize my return over the long-term. At the same time, I do not want to over-invest and face outsize risk from market downturns.

#### II. Resist unnecessary increases in consumption, but deploy capital when it has high potential ROI.
 * Both of these are suggestive of problems with capital allocation:
   * increasing spending due to hedonic adaptation
   * limiting spending due to overly emphasizing frugality
 * I need to critically consider how my spending habits impact the life I want to lead. I generally have a tendency to over-save/under-spend, and need to remind myself that this approach does not maximize happiness.

#### III. Achieve solvency in retirement without expectations of external payouts.
 * Ultimately, I aim to capitalize on all possible tax-advantaged accounts now with the belief that I can lower realized taxes later. I am confident that if planned correctly, retirement is not a difficult task to save for with the current incentive structures that are provided by the US government.

## General Beliefs
Changes in this category may come 1-2 times per year, particularly as I learn more about investing.
 * **Passive Investing.** Broadly, I do not believe in the promise of active investing. Passive investing is the only realistic strategy for any investment horizon. I aim to resist the temptation to take part in either active funds or strategies that are similar to active investing, such as arbitrage or 'timing the market'.
 * **Minimize Taxes.** Avoiding additional taxation is like free returns.
 * **Low Expense Ratios.** Since the payment of the expense ratio is the only thing a fund can guarantee, it should be a focus for any passive investor to keep these as low as possible.
 * **Resist Asset Allocation Obsession.** Nobody knows what allocation is the 'fairest', and any glide path to retirement is the opinion of someone. I aim to ignore allocation specifics and take the opinion of those I trust at face value (ex. Vanguard Target Date Retirement funds, Wealthfront funds, etc.)
 * **Minimize Uninvested Money.** Money that isn't in the market is by default losing value to inflation. Even money invested in an asset that doesn't return anything has at least been used as useful capital for a business or a government.
 * **Avoid Loans and Illiquid Investments.** Illiquid investments like real estate property or stock in a startup and loans for cars or houses come with extreme flexibility costs; loans have the additional risk of artificially increasing one's standard of living expectations.
 * **Avoid Long-term Bets on Taxes.** Nobody can predict how tax rates will change over time, especially on the horizon of decades. Investing completely in pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (roth) accounts can be seen as a bet that taxes will either be lower or higher in retirement (respectively). Avoid taking either 'bet' by allocating contributions to equalize the estimated post-tax amount.

## Specific Implementation Details
Changes may happen frequently in this category (multiple times a year), since they are highly dependent on my current job situation (retired vs. not), location, living situation, relationship status, etc.
 * **Keep cash holdings within 3-5 months of expenses.** There is no need to keep a large amount of money in cash, particularly when I have significant credit (credit cards, [PLOC](https://www.wealthfront.com/portfolio-line-of-credit)) readily available. The target holding is 4 months.
 * **Maximize all possible tax-advantaged accounts.** See above for description. It usually makes sense to contribute the maximum to the 401k and IRA, when possible.
 * **Prefer tax-advantaged contributions that are reversible.** Contributions & earnings in traditional accounts are fully illiquid until retirement age (unless you're willing to take a penalty). Contributions to Roth accounts can generally be taken out any time, tax-free. There is an inherent tension between the flexibility objective and the tax bet avoidance belief mentioned above. Until I have more clarity about what my retirement will look like (particularly geographically), and what my medium-term money access needs will be, I should maximize flexibility by allowing over-investment into Roth accounts. This trades tax optimality for flexibility, a better decision for an uncertain future.
 * **Invest all other money in low-cost taxable funds.** Currently, the funds are in Vanguard and Wealthfront.
 * **Classify all spending.** In order to track consumption, I need dependable information on where money is actually flowing. Currently, the only solution that I know of which can results in accurate results is manually logging transactions and classifying them into categories (Food, Household, Clothes, Transportation, etc.). I've been doing so since August 2016.
